## Description

This is a Capstone Project for Udacity's Machine learning engeneering Nanodegree.

Project Overview
Booking an entire apartment, home, etc. during a trip is becoming increasingly common over time. Rather than book a room in a hotel, people have preferred entire places,
whether by privacy or saving some money. In such context, Airbnb is nowadays one of the most important service for booking apartments, home, or any kind of place for 
staying during a trip or even a place to rent for living. 
Whatever the reason, one important factor in this kind of transaction is the price. A host looks for aiming the best price which gives a good financial return and keeps 
the place booked most of the time, and the guests look for the best price considering the benefits. 
That said, having a way of predicting the prices according to historical data is a valuable tool. For this purpose, evaluating the best options is the main goal of this 
project.

My personal motivation for this is because I am a heavy user of Airbnb service.
